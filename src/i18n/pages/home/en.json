        "description": "Inserting a custom string can increase security and prevent direct recognition, especially suitable for obfuscating sensitive information such as passwords. For example, if you encode your password without adding a fixed string, others can use your password directly. If you add a specific string, others can obtain the encoded result and decode it without deleting the specific string. It should be noted that the fixed string needs to be a string that you often use, to prevent yourself from forgetting it and being unable to use it. It is recommended to fill in: base64s.com"
