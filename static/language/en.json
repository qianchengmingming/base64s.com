        "Protecting your encoded data is crucial in today's digital world. Our platform provides two powerful security features to enhance the protection of your Base64 encoded content:",
        "## 🔐 Auto-Add String Feature",
        "The Auto-Add String feature is your first line of defense. Here's how it works:",
        "- **Add Custom String**: Before encoding, the system automatically adds your personal string to the content",
        "- **Remove on Decode**: When decoding, the system removes this string, revealing the original content",
        "- **Security Benefit**: Even if someone intercepts your encoded data and decodes it, they'll get content mixed with your custom string, making it unusable",
        "**Example:**",
        "- Original: `Hello World`",
        "- With string `MySecret123`: `MySecret123Hello WorldMySecret123`",
        "- After encoding: Completely different Base64 result",
        "- Attacker gets: Mixed content that's meaningless without knowing your custom string",
        "## 🔄 Multiple Encoding Feature",
        "Double or triple the security with multiple encoding rounds:",
        "- **Multiple Rounds**: Encode your content 2, 3, or more times",
        "- **Exponential Security**: Each round exponentially increases cracking difficulty",
        "- **Smart Decoding**: Our system automatically detects and reverses multiple encoding rounds",
        "**Security Mathematics:**",
        "- 1x encoding: Standard security",
        "- 2x encoding: Security squared",
        "- 3x encoding: Security cubed",
        "## 🛡️ Best Practices",
        "For maximum security, combine both features:",
        "1. **Use a memorable but unique string** (avoid common words)",
        "2. **Choose 2-3 encoding rounds** (more rounds = longer processing time)",
        "3. **Keep your custom string private** (treat it like a password)",
        "4. **Use different strings for different purposes**",
        "Remember: The strength of this security lies in the secrecy of your custom string and the number of encoding rounds. Even with advanced computing power, cracking multiple rounds with unknown custom strings is extremely difficult."
